                <h4>Anything For A Friend is a community fundraising organization started by Becky Anderson. They help tragedy stricken families
            raise money to help with the financial strain of medical bills amassed while trying to save a loved one's life.<br /><br />
                This was a project for a capstone course that included the whole class (over 30 students), and we were very excited to be able to
                    help such a great organization.

                <p>This was an N-tier project using ASP.NET to build an event registration service that would allow users to sign up through AFAF's website.
                This would allow them to take the profits which they would normally pay event hosting sites and give it all to the families in need.

                <p>The class was split into 3 tiers (Presentation, Business Logic, and Database) and I was placed in the Presentation tier as the lead designer.
                I designed all the mockups for the site's layout and look while getting feedback from my team and Becky.  I also worked with the others on the html/css and validation.

            <div class="textBox">
                <p>The project was completed on the presentation side by the end of the course, and mostly completed by the other tiers.  We were able to give a presentation to Becky and
               her team, and they were very thrilled about it.  More time was still needed to have the service ready for the next fundraiser, and the next semester students would be finishing
                   our project and adding some of the extra features.
